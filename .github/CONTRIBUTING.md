See the [Scientific Python Developer Guide][spc-dev-intro] for a detailed
description of best practices for developing scientific packages.

# Setting up a development environment manually

You can set up a development environment by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source ./.venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]
```

If you have the
[Python Launcher for Unix](https://github.com/brettcannon/python-launcher), you
can instead do:

```bash
py -m venv .venv
py -m install -v -e .[dev]
```

# Post setup

You should prepare pre-commit, which will help you by checking that commits pass
required checks:

```bash
pip install pre-commit # or brew install pre-commit on macOS
pre-commit install # Will install a pre-commit hook into the git repo
```

You can also/alternatively run `pre-commit run` (changes only) or
`pre-commit run --all-files` to check even without installing the hook.

# Testing

Use pytest to run the unit checks:

```bash
pytest
```

# Coverage

Use pytest-cov to generate coverage reports:

```bash
pytest --cov=harmonwig
```
